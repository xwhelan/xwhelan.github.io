## In Space, Nobody Wants to Work

Let's say that you have an established commercial line of business. You need an office on the Moon, because everyone does. Even Wayland-Yutani has a campus on the Sea of Tranquility.

Staffing a moonbase requires a talent pipeline of highly qualified candidates, who have preferably already worked in space. Military pilots, aerospace engineers, surgeons, psychologists, chemists... and janitors. Somebody has to keep the floors clean.

So you, the hiring manager, write this job description.

Yet you find that it's hard to find qualified candidates for janitors. Job description:

> You are passionate about exploring the final frontier and pushing the
> boundaries of what humanity even thinks is possible. We want you to
> come to the moon to keep our state of the art facilities clean and
> sanitary.

## High Stakes, Low Payoff

As a moonbase janitor, your best day would be keeping everything clean.

Your worst day is explosive decompression and everyone dies.

Or consider that your secondary qualifications are vast and broad and utterly essential to enable you to push that broom in lunar gravity... because there will be no unskilled labor in space. You already did years of training and practice to get there.

And yet, someone watching you wash windows, on the outside, in a spacesuit, being careful not to kick up mosondust and ruining your work,
would look out and you and think:

"How hard could that be?"

The answer is always: "Much harder than you think."

Stay frosty, space custodians.

## The Great (Obsolete) Books

If there is a used book I know I want, I can get it via Amazon or AbeBooks.

This is what I did after I read ["Six Works of Computer Science-Fiction"](http://blog.fogus.me/2015/04/27/six-works-of-computer-science-fiction/), having already read about half of the [online free edition](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/) of the venerable "Wizard Book", AKA _Structures and Interpretation of Computer Science_ by Abelson & Sussman.

The other ones were tantalizing, so I sought out used physical copies of them. They were all cheap and readily available, except for Kogge's magisterial _The Architecture of Symbolic Computers_ never less than a hundred dollars when it's even on the market.

There are other lists, [and they are all real](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/q/10997)

This has become the nucleus of a particular collection: textbooks and professional text on computer science and electrical engineering printed before 2000. For example: Rodnay Zaks' [_Programming the Z80_](https://archive.org/details/Programming_the_Z-80_2nd_Edition_1980_Rodnay_Zaks), but the Radio Shack edition.

Why do this? I believe that in computing, it is necessary to understand the development of our modern systems and the foundations upon which they were built. (For the Internet, UNIX and C) In this case, "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny".

Most of the classics are listed, categorized, reissued, and reprinted. But what about the lost gems, the dead ends, the rest of the story?

## Finding What I Don't Know I Want

Within the parameters I set (printed before 2000, written on computing for a professional audience), I can go to a(ny) used bookstore, search, and know whether a volume is worth purchasing. _SAP For Dummies_, 2005, is right out.

## Recent Find: _The Visualization Toolkit, 2nd Edition_

![The Visualization Toolkit, 2nd Edition](/assets/images/visualization_toolkit.jpg)

### Provenance

Found in [Lyrical Ballad Bookstore](https://www.facebook.com/Lyrical-Ballad-Bookstore-157339480976029/), Saratoga Springs, NY. Was located in the same vicinity as two books on the related [ITK](http://www.itk.org), both of which were published within the last ten years (and CC-licensed) so not of interest to the collection.

The examples in the text are primarily of medical imaging, suggesting that this was the primary use case for C\+\+ based professional visualization software (outside of gaming) from the late nineties. This also implies that all three volumes were owned by the same person, who might have been in academia in a field adjacent to medical computing.

### Why Read It?

This is an interesting window into data visualization and imaging prior to the current era of open source, interpreted-language runtimes such as Python/Pandas or RStudio. Before the web, operationalizing imaging analysis would have been on the desktop, targeting either Windows or high-end UNIX workstations, and would have been tailored to domain specific use cases like radiological imaging.

The book had the unmistakable look of some sort of [TeX](https://tug.org) based typesetting, and was in good condition, and even had its companion CD-ROM intact. Will update with what I find.
